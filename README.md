# MazeGameWeek5

In this chapter we'll complete our look at C++ with some further troubleshooting opportunities and time to finish off our previous challenges. There are no video tutorials in this chapter.

Challenges:

- Download and analyse the most up to date MazeGame on the repo, where threading has now been included in the project.
- Flag the remaining issues that have been included for analysis, and what can be done to fix them.
- Use your class slack channel as a forum to discuss the issues and potential solutions.
